# Research: Implement Dark Mode

## 1. Testing Framework

- **Unknown**: No testing framework is specified in `package.json`.
- **Task**: Research and recommend a testing framework for a Next.js application.
- **Decision**: **Vitest** is recommended.
- **Rationale**: Vitest is a modern, fast, and Jest-compatible testing framework that works well with Vite and Next.js. It requires minimal configuration and provides a great developer experience.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Jest, Playwright. Jest is a classic choice but can be slower. Playwright is for end-to-end testing, which is overkill for the current needs of unit and component testing.

## 2. State Management

- **Unknown**: The project does not have a dedicated global state management library.
- **Task**: Research and recommend a state management library for React/Next.js.
- **Decision**: **Zustand** is recommended.
- **Rationale**: Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management solution. It's simple to use, unopinionated, and doesn't require boilerplate code like context providers. It aligns with the principle of keeping things simple.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Redux, Jotai. Redux is powerful but adds significant complexity and boilerplate. Jotai is also a good atomic state management library, but Zustand is slightly more established and a bit simpler for this project's scale.
