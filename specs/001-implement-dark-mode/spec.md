## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to toggle a dark mode for the application so that I can use it comfortably in low-light environments and reduce eye strain.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is in light mode, **When** I click the theme toggle button in the navigation bar, **Then** the application's theme changes to dark mode with a smooth fade effect.
2. **Given** the application is in dark mode, **When** I click the theme toggle button in the navigation bar, **Then** the application's theme changes to light mode with a smooth fade effect.
3. **Given** I have selected dark mode, **When** I close and reopen or refresh the application, **Then** the application remains in dark mode.
4. **Given** I have selected light mode, **When** I close and reopen or refresh the application, **Then** the application remains in light mode.

### Edge Cases
- If local storage is unavailable, the theme setting is stored in a cookie.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a theme toggle button in the main navigation bar.
- **FR-002**: The toggle button MUST visually represent the action of switching between light and dark themes (e.g., with a sun and moon icon).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST not use a menu item for the theme toggle; it must be a direct button.
- **FR-004**: The application's current theme (light or dark) MUST be managed as part of a global UI application state.
- **FR-005**: The selected theme MUST be persisted in the browser's local storage to ensure it remains after a page refresh or new session.
- **FR-006**: On initial load, the application MUST apply the theme stored in local storage, if one exists.
- **FR-007**: If local storage is not available, the system MUST use a cookie as a fallback for persisting the theme setting.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The transition between light and dark mode MUST be a smooth fade to provide a pleasant user experience.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **UI Theme State**: Represents the current theme state of the application.
  - Attributes: `theme: ('light' | 'dark')`
