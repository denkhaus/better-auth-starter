# Quickstart for Replace Resend with Brevo for Email Service

This document outlines the steps to quickly verify the successful implementation of the feature.

## Verification Steps

1.  **Verify Email Sending via Brevo API:**
    - Trigger an email sending event in the application (e.g., user registration, password reset).
    - Observe the application logs to confirm that the Brevo API is being called for email delivery.
    - Check the Brevo platform dashboard to confirm the email was sent and delivered successfully.

2.  **Verify Dependency Management:**
    - Open the `package.json` file in the project root.
    - Confirm that the `resend` package is no longer listed as a dependency.
    - Confirm that the `brevo` (or equivalent Brevo SDK) package is listed as a dependency.

3.  **Verify Error Handling:**
    - Intentionally provide an invalid Brevo API key in the environment variables.
    - Trigger an email sending event.
    - Observe the application logs to confirm that appropriate error handling is triggered and logged, without exposing sensitive information.
