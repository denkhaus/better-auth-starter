# Feature Specification: Replace Resend with Brevo for Email Service

**Feature Branch**: `002-ich-m-chte`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Ich m√∂chte die Resend Library durch die Brevo Library austauschen und den kompletten E-Mail-Verkehr nur noch √ºber Brevo abwickeln."

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to replace the Resend email library with the Brevo email library to consolidate email services and potentially reduce costs or gain new features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application needs to send an email (e.g., user registration confirmation), **When** the email sending function is called, **Then** the email is successfully sent using the Brevo API.
2. **Given** the application's dependencies are reviewed, **When** I check the `package.json` file, **Then** the Resend library is removed and the Brevo library (or its SDK) is present.
3. **Given** an email has been sent via the application, **When** I check the email logs or dashboard in the Brevo platform, **Then** the sent email is logged correctly and shows successful delivery.
4. **Given** the application is running, **When** an email sending operation fails (e.g., due to invalid API key), **Then** appropriate error handling is triggered and logged, without exposing sensitive information.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the Brevo API key is invalid or missing? The system should fail gracefully with logging.
- Are there any specific email templates or functionalities (e.g., transactional vs. marketing emails) that need special consideration during the migration? Not at the moment.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: If Brevo API key is invalid/missing, should it fall back to another service or fail gracefully with logging? ‚Üí A: Fail gracefully with logging.
- Q: Are there specific email templates/functionalities needing special consideration? ‚Üí A: Nicht im Moment.
- Q: What are the target email sending latency and throughput? ‚Üí A: throughput: small, latency: <= 5m.
- Q: Are specific metrics or tracing required for email sending? ‚Üí A: no.
- Q: What is the expected daily email volume? ‚Üí A: <=10.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST use the Brevo API for all outgoing email communications.
- **FR-002**: The Resend library and its related configurations MUST be completely removed from the project.
- **FR-003**: The official Brevo SDK or a suitable Brevo API client MUST be integrated into the project dependencies.
- **FR-004**: All existing email sending logic (e.g., for user verification, password resets) MUST be refactored to utilize the newly integrated Brevo client.
- **FR-005**: Environment variables for email service configuration MUST be updated to reflect Brevo's API keys and endpoint details.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Email Service**: Represents the abstract service responsible for sending emails.
  - Attributes: `provider: ('Brevo')`, `apiKey: string`, `senderEmail: string`
- **Data Volume**: Expected daily email volume is <= 10.

## Non-Functional Quality Attributes
- **Performance**: Email sending throughput should be small, with latency <= 5 minutes.
- **Observability**: No specific metrics or tracing required for email sending beyond existing logging.
