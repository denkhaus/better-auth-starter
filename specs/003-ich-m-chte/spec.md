# Feature Specification: Implement Internationalization with Next-intl

**Feature Branch**: `003-ich-m-chte`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Ich m√∂chte im Internationalisierung implementieren mit der Next-intl Library. Die Sprachen sollen englisch und deutsch sein, wobei deutsch die Default-Sprache ist. Sorge auch daf√ºr, dass alle Better-Auth-Komponenten mehrsprachig implementiert sind. Vermerke das neue Feature Internationalisierung in zwei Sprachen auf der Startseite, sowie in der Readme."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to be able to switch between English and German languages on the website, so that I can use the application in my preferred language. As a developer, I want to implement internationalization using the Next-intl library, ensuring all Better-Auth components are multilingual, and document this feature on the homepage and in the README.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is loaded, **When** no language preference is set, **Then** the application defaults to German.
2. **Given** the application is loaded, **When** a user selects English, **Then** all visible text elements, including Better-Auth components, switch to English.
3. **Given** the application is loaded, **When** a user selects German, **Then** all visible text elements, including Better-Auth components, switch to German.
4. **Given** the application's homepage, **When** I view it, **Then** the internationalization feature is mentioned in both English and German.
5. **Given** the project's `README.md` file, **When** I open it, **Then** there is a section documenting the internationalization feature.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a translation for a specific text element is missing for a selected language? The application will fall back to the default language (German).
- How will language preferences be persisted (e.g., cookie, local storage, user profile)? The application will use local storage to persist language preferences.
- Are there any dynamic content elements that need to be internationalized (e.g., dates, numbers, user-generated content)? Yes, all locale-specific formats including dates and numbers will be internationalized.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The application MUST implement internationalization using the Next-intl library.
- **FR-002**: The supported languages MUST be English (en) and German (de).
- **FR-003**: German (de) MUST be the default language for the application.
- **FR-004**: All user-facing text within the application, including all Better-Auth components, MUST be translatable into English and German.
- **FR-005**: The homepage MUST display a mention of the internationalization feature in both English and German.
- **FR-006**: The `README.md` file MUST include documentation about the internationalization feature.
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to switch between English and German languages via a simple toggle button like [DE|EN] highlighting the current language.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The application MUST fall back to the default language (German) when translations are missing for a selected language.
- **NFR-002**: Language preferences MUST be persisted using local storage for returning users.
- **NFR-003**: Locale-specific formats such as dates and numbers MUST be internationalized per selected language.
